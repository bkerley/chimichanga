Welcome to Chimichanga
======================

Chimichanga is a crummy stack based language I wrote because I was
tired and bored after moving stuff and shopping in my sweet new
apartment in Miami.

What are pre2c.rb and init.pre?
-------------------------------

I wanted a nice way to add procs that required a bit more intuition
than I know how to get out of the C preprocessor, and that also made
the finished C easy to inspect.

pre2c basically tallies up the dispatch calls, translates the names
into valid C function names, and sticks them all in a function at the
end that's called at startup to load up the procs into the symbol
dictionary.

It also does macro replacement, mostly to make binary operations nice
and short.

Who do I complain to?
---------------------

Nominally, you can complain to bkerley@brycekerley.net

In practice, it's your own fault for using chimichnga instead of one
of these completely fine alternatives (listed in reverse alphabetical
order):

* Postscript (or Ghostscript)
* Forth
* Factor
